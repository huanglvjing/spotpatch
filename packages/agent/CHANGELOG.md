# @spotpatch/agent

## 1.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 2d98a66: Add an Astro development integration with native template and React-island source markers, bounded source context, shared AI review/apply/revert, read-only Contextual Ask, external-Agent Inbox/managed controls and Astro-aware trusted validation. Share service ownership across Vite, Next and Astro without changing their transport boundaries. Add original-coordinate native source projections, browser-script instrumentation and scoped navigation exclusions; never infer server execution from browser observations. Preserve JSX markers, production isolation and existing security policies. Compatibility and external-Agent maturity remain limited to the documented evidence; this change does not publish the new package.
- 2d98a66: Add a shared, accessible Managed Codex Ask model picker backed by the local model catalog, with bounded discovery, execution-time validation and explicit model dispatch.

## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 0d3a94b: Add the capability-gated Contextual Ask beta across the shared protocol, immutable source snapshots, Configured Key and Managed Codex read-only executors, Vite and Next transports, and the lazy Runtime planner UI. Ask requires an explicit element selection, returns a single cited answer, never exposes write tools or persistent chat history, and can convert the current answer into an editable local Change draft without creating a write job.

  The release gate now packs every public package and installs the tarballs together in a clean npm consumer before exercising real Vite and Next development and production hosts. CI covers Node 20 and 22 on Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS, the audited Vite 5/6/7 and Next 15/16 host matrix, Windows native npm Codex resolution, production leakage, package exports, and the existing compatibility suites.

## 1.4.1

### Patch Changes

- 02e4f5d: Publish the capability-gated Codex compatibility path and the unified Dynamic Island runtime. Stable Codex releases at or above the supported baseline are validated against the exact executable's generated App Server schema and the existing live safety preflight instead of a hard-coded minor-version ceiling; incompatible capabilities continue to fail closed to Inbox, and managed execution recovers missing threads without weakening isolation.

  Runtime now owns the single motion implementation and public motion registration entry consumed by both Vite and Next, so both adapters ship the same production Dynamic Island UI, shared morph behavior, reduced-motion handling, and lifecycle cleanup without duplicated CSS or adapter-specific animation code.

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 1f1e170: Add the opt-in, development-only external Agent handoff and managed-dispatch foundation: a memory-only authenticated loopback Broker, project-scoped discovery, request-idempotent handoffs, a per-development-session writer lease, four project-content-read-only MCP tools, a persistent Bridge event pump, experimental Claude Channel support, safe Inbox setup generators, and shared Vite/Next lifecycle integration. Codex managed mode is owned by `pnpm dev` and uses a page control surface backed by terminal consent, a user-private project grant, independent Git metadata/workspace snapshots, restricted read roots, per-revision App Server threads, fixed no-network/no-approval policy, allowed-path and cache-pollution audits, explicit required checks, hash-safe apply, structured progress, and honest Inbox fallback. A project-keyed private Codex runtime home prevents inherited user MCP/hooks/plugins from bypassing the sandbox; strict hook/MCP preflight, a restricted model-shell environment, bounded opaque file-auth linking, and exact revoke cleanup fail closed without writing runtime state into the business repository. Managed snapshots require only the authorized target paths to be tracked and clean; unrelated local changes remain outside the snapshot and are preserved. Cursor and generic MCP hosts remain Inbox-only. This is local-validation functionality and does not declare stable Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, managed real-host, or cross-platform release support.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [1f1e170]
  - @spotpatch/shared@1.11.0

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- df52b66: Make the explicitly consented trusted mode a direct, low-latency path. It now
  starts from SpotPatch's exact source location, omits the `run_check` tool,
  skips host project checks, and applies the isolated Diff immediately while
  retaining project boundaries, atomic patching, conflict detection, and Revert.
  Review and gated auto modes continue to run configured checks.

## 1.2.4

### Patch Changes

- 8bd8e88: Keep denied or unavailable `read_file` calls inside the bounded Agent loop so
  the model can recover through allowed discovery results without weakening path
  or write protections.
- Updated dependencies [14c3a48]
  - @spotpatch/shared@1.7.0

## 1.2.3

### Patch Changes

- 1a7628b: Start real Agent jobs without a redundant two-request capability preflight,
  parallelize independent reads, cache worktree discovery and file content with
  write-aware invalidation, and reuse current host-run validation results. Supply
  bounded nearby project configuration and sibling-code evidence so generated
  changes follow the target repository's existing style and file organization.

## 1.2.2

### Patch Changes

- 0218aa7: Preserve completed element selections and their individual page context across
  same-project navigation, reloads, and workbench close/reopen cycles. Detached DOM
  nodes are released while sanitized target context remains available, and a
  non-secret development session identity prevents stale drafts from crossing
  server restarts.
- 2bbdafc: Replace oversized npm README logos with a compact icon-and-package-name heading
  that remains consistently sized when npm sanitizes image attributes.

## 1.2.1

### Patch Changes

- f12538d: Allow OpenAI-compatible relays to reuse a provider tool call ID in a later model
  turn without replaying an earlier result. Idempotency and activity tracking are
  now scoped by SpotPatch turn, while conflicting IDs within one turn still fail
  closed before source mutation.

  Report malformed tool arguments and same-turn call ID conflicts as distinct,
  actionable errors. Parsed argument objects that miss the strict contract now
  return a bounded zero-mutation retry result so the model can correct them with a
  new call ID.

- Updated dependencies [f12538d]
  - @spotpatch/shared@1.4.0

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 41b5f3f: Add explicit local-workspace health checks and an opt-in isolated baseline for staged, unstaged, and untracked changes. Applying or reverting now preserves pre-existing edits and the Git index while rejecting conflicts on Agent-touched files with more precise diagnostics.

  Improve the provider and model controls with an accessible customizable native picker in supported Chromium versions, including a natural below-field transition and a native fallback.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [41b5f3f]
  - @spotpatch/shared@1.3.0

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 3b15243: Add secure convention-based AI setup for `spotPatch()`, a concise single-provider
  configuration API, and restricted `x-api-key` authentication alongside Bearer
  credentials. Complete `SPOTPATCH_AI_*` environment values now enable AI without
  duplicating provider defaults, while partial configuration fails fast and secrets
  remain confined to the Vite Node process.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [3b15243]
  - @spotpatch/shared@1.1.0

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 8b49469: Release the initial SpotPatch v1 implementation with development-only source
  markers, secure local source access, React 18 resolution, sanitized multi-target
  context collection, bilingual prompt composition, a contextual Shadow DOM
  workbench, and an optional review-gated AI code Agent.
