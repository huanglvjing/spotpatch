Add the opt-in, development-only external Agent handoff and active-dispatch foundation: a memory-only authenticated loopback Broker, project-scoped discovery, request-idempotent handoffs, a per-development-session managed-writer lease/dispatch state machine, four project-content-read-only MCP tools, a persistent Bridge event pump, experimental Claude Channel and Codex App Server adapters, safe Inbox setup generators, truthful Runtime status, and shared Vite/Next lifecycle integration. Codex active mode is a single explicit command that injects SpotPatch MCP into its owned App Server thread without writing project Codex configuration. Cursor and generic MCP hosts remain Inbox-only, and the managed lease does not claim an operating-system-wide writer lock. This is local-validation functionality and does not declare stable Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, or cross-platform release support.
